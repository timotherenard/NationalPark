			<h2> History of the National Park</h2>
			<p>
			Proposals to create a park were first raised beginning in 1985. 
			The French Ministry of the Environment was officially consulted for the creation of a national park in 
			Les Hauts, the mountainous interior of the island.
			Between 2000 and 2003, a consultation process was launched. On 29 March 2003, the French
			Prime Minister signed a decree acknowledging the project.

			Debates and negotiations on the limits and objectives of the future national park intensified. 
			A survey took place which showed a positive responde to the project by the populations.
			The park officially came into existence on 5 March 2007. In 2008, work began to set up the charter of the national park.
			On 1 August 2010, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee acknowledged the value of the natural sites within Réunion National Park, 
			and included the "Pitons, cirques and remparts of Réunion Island" in its World Heritage list.

			<h2>Geography of the Park</h2>
			<p>	The core of Réunion National Park covers 1,053.84 km2 (406.89 sq mi) in the interior of the island, corresponding to 42% of its surface and extending 
				over the land of 23 communes. This core area also includes some inhabited and cultivated land. Adjacent to the core is an area of voluntary commitment 
				(aire d'adhésion, buffer zone) covering 876.96 km2 (338.60 sq mi) and touching all 24 communes on the island. Altogether, the park extends over more than 
				75% of the island. The island of Réunion is volcanic in origin and sits over a hotspot. Two volcanoes form its backbone: The Piton des Neiges, 
				over 3,000 m (9,800 ft) high, and the still active Piton de la Fournaise.
